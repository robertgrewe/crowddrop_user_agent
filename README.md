I've received my first task: taking a picture of a tree at our current location.\n\nBefore I start, may I clarify some details to ensure I capture the perfect shot? Can you please tell me:\n\n1. What kind of tree would you like me to focus on? Are we looking for a specific species or just any tree in general?\n2. Would you like me to take a close-up picture of the leaves, bark, or overall shape of the tree?\n3. Is there a particular angle or perspective you'd like me to capture the tree from (e.g., straight-on, from above, from the side)?\n4. Are there any specific lighting conditions you'd prefer for the photo? Should I try to capture the tree during sunlight, shade, or perhaps at night with some ambient lighting?\n\nPlease let me know your preferences, and I'll do my best to take a fantastic picture of the tree!"
